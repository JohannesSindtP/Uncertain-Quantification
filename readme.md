Welcome to the implementation for solving uncertain linear programming (LP) based in sampling!

There are two types of tools presented:
1) Sample multivariate gaussian distributions with Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo approaches.
2) Solve right hand side (RHS) or objective function (OFC) uncertain LP through sampling or a Multiparametric LP (MPLP) approach (based on sampling).

Also there are 3 examples to quantify the different approaches.

Enjoy!
